            My name is Kit, and I am the creator of this platform. I worked as an Insurance Broker for 17 months from June 2022 to October 2023, where there was a lot of time searching for insurers that could underwrite a client and their business activities. Having undertaken a fact-find with a client, I would approach many insurers which often proved fruitless as there was either an aspect of the risk to be insured that couldn’t be covered, or the entire risk was incompatible with their product resulting with me turning to another insurer. The insurance industry mainly uses Acturis for its content management system (policy creation, adjustments and communication) and the software provides for market placement which are known as “E-Trade Policies” however the offering is restricted. I recognised the system is driven by rules and I discovered an opportunity to create a platform incorporating a fundamental rule not presently incorporated into Acturis and is often overlooked by brokers. My platform reflects some of the risk appetites (currently trades shown are up to Loft Converter) for nine insurers (Allianz, Arch, AXA, Aviva, Covea, NIG, RSA, QBE and Zurich) that serve Tradesman and Professionals Policies for Howden/APlan Insurance Brokers. By being able to replicate the rules that govern Acturis means additional rules can be added by the broker, further trades can be added and rated, and the risk appetites of manual insurers (Not E-Trade Policies) can be incorporated into the platform and rated as well. A marketplace of insurers housing all their appetites will ensure all insurer offerings are considered, aims to prevent breach of insurer product rules, and should reduce time spent searching for a compatible insurer.

            This platform is for demonstration purposes only use and was designed to act as a screener before creating a policy with an insurer. This system is not a complete substitute for ensuring policy suitability and you must check the risk profiles of the insurer and validate the data gathered from your client fact-find to assess a policy suitability prior to any policy placement.
