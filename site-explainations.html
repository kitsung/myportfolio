        <h3>Broker Assist</h3>
        <p>There are many considerations that must be made when arranging insurance for a person, business, or entity, one of these considerations are the number of payments made to bona fide subcontractors and the number of subcontractors used throughout the year, which is often missed by brokers, or they people are unaware of the rule. It is difficult to keep track of different insurer rules and appetites which is where this idea arose – my intention was to simplify the policy placement process and reduce the risk of invalidating a policy.</p>
        <p>The most difficult aspect of this project was having to manually list all the trades and each insurer appetite for each trade – a task that I couldn’t finish having left the company during the build.</p>

        <h3>Poker Game</h3>
        <p>I had to create a game to be submitted as part of my portfolio to be considered for a bootcamp. The games are a replica of an arcade game I used to play called “Joker Poker” however does not incorporate jokers which would have functioned as wild cards.</p>
        <p>The logic for the game took a long time to develop and fortunately there were other people who had made a similar game – still I had to understand how the code was compiled and decide whether and how to implement it into my project. All code was handwritten by me. Most notable difficulties met was reordering a pack of random cards and ranking poker hands. Backend was built largely using arrays.</p>
