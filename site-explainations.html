        <h3>Broker Assist</h3>
        <p>There are many considerations that must be made when arranging insurance for a person, business, and entity, one of these considerations is the amount paid to bona fide subcontractors and the number of subcontractors used throughout the year, which is often missed by brokers, or people are unaware of the rule. It’s difficult to keep track of different insurer rules and appetites which is where this idea arose – my intention was to simplify the policy placement process and to reduce the risk of invalidating a policy.</p>
        <p>The most arduous aspect in this project was having to manually include all the trades and to find and set out each insurer appetite for each trade – a task that I couldn’t finish having left the company during the build.</p>

        <h3>Poker Game</h3>
        <p>I had to create a game to be submitted as part of my portfolio to be considered for a bootcamp. The game is a replica of an arcade game I use to play called “Joker Poker” but doesn’t incorporate the jokers which would have functioned as wild cards. The number of guesses in the high low game would reduce dependant on the winning poker hand.</p>
        <p>I handwrote all code, the logic for the game took a long time to develop, I was confident the game could be coded giving the coding concepts I had but I encountered setbacks at times. For example, I needed to find a method to reorder a random pack of playing cards and a way to rank a poker hand. Fortunately, there were other people who had made a similar game but still I had to understand how their code was compiled and decide whether and how to implement it into my project. The high low game was built around DOM manipulation on hiding the right card though the card had already been determined but required the user to guess correctly to see it. Backend was built mostly using arrays.</p>
