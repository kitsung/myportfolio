        <h3 class="about-me">Coding Background</h3>
        <p>I dabbled in coding in 2019 and many years before and on both occasions, I found it difficult to learn. I resorted to looking for the easiest language to begin with which still didn’t help, started with Python, and quit soon afterwards – in fact printing “Hello World” was as far as I had got.</p>
        <p>In 2017, I begun learning Mandarin and Korean and in 2020 I tried to become a Paraplanner and undertook lots of self-studying. Having completed half of the modules needed to qualify as a Paraplanner, I gave up hope of becoming a Paraplanner after I found it too hard getting a job in finance.</p>
        <p>In 2021, I came across a video on programming where the hosts also computer programmers had started to learn real world languages and since I was learning languages before, and coding is a language and having picked up Mandarin I tried to learn coding once again but this time with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Learning to code alone was still difficult but I had got further than I had previously, so I continued with this path since I saw progress. There were more resources available than previously – rise of code academies and online courses. I learnt to code using the freeCodeCamp platform, Scrimba (coding platform) and YouTube – repeated tutorials and exercises until I understood what was being taught. The most difficult aspect of coding is putting all the code together and the technical concepts that I need to be aware of and accept. To help with this, there were several approaches I would take - I would research into the area by reading articles and watching videos that explain things in as many ways possible to help fill the gaps in my knowledge and I would look at other people solutions to problems I encountered. I continued to build on and strengthen my knowledge by taking courses and attending coding meetups.</p>
        <h3 class="about-me">Coding Future</h3>
        <p>I never had the intention of working in the tech industry when I started learning to code. Coding still appeals to me as it means I can now turn ideas into digital solutions by starting from a blank canvas - it has also been a great past time for me. I chose to specialise in web development because my creations can be easily accessible to everyone. My intention is to make products that address a need or tries to digitise a practice. I enjoy learning now more than I was in the school system and to cement my learning, I’ve always broken down a concept so each part can be found, and their role understood; only then would I feel comfortable I had a true understanding of something. As I got better at coding, I’ve become better at recognising the number of parts to make something work. My motivation to learning more about coding is so I can become better at recognising all these parts and their order earlier on and to have the skills to overcome any obstacles. Taking all this into account, I now know what is fuelling my enthusiasm and it would be ideal for me to continue this journey by working as a Web Developer / Software Developer.  </p>
